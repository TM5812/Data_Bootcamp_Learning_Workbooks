**Data Analyst In Training**

Hi there, my name is Thandeka ‚Äî a Psychology graduate who is currently training to be a junior data analyst after completing a data bootcamp with Just IT. My learning journey hasn't been easy, but it's been real, honest, and fuelled with curiosity.

I didn't come from a traditional technical background. My degree touched upon working with and understanding data but nothing massively technical. For a long time ‚Äî and sometimes even now ‚Äî I doubted whether I had a "data or maths brain." However, I am learning that analysis isn't just about numbers ‚Äî it's about asking meaningful questions, organising chaos, and discovering patterns that add value to people and businesses in making effective decisions.

I value honesty, reflection, and learning by doing. I'm not someone who pretends to know it all ‚Äî I ask questions, dig deep, and work hard to make sense of problems. If I don't know something, I'll figure it out. If I'm stuck, I'll stay curious. That's the mindset I bring into every challenge.

I care deeply about the human side of things ‚Äî especially mental health and social impact. I also have a mind that likes to spot patterns and put them together into a bigger picture. Data feels like a powerful way to bridge those values with real-world decision-making. I'm drawn to projects that go beyond the technical ‚Äî ones that help make a difference, even if in small ways.

### Throughout the bootcamp, I built a foundational understanding and applied knowledge in:

- Excel, Tableau, and Power BI for data cleaning and visualisation  
- SQL basics  
- Python (using Google Colab, Pandas, Matplotlib)  
- Understanding data protection and compliance (e.g. GDPR, DPA 2018)  
- Structuring analytical thinking from raw datasets to business insights  

Beyond this, I have a lot to learn, but I've been working hard to build confidence through small wins and hands-on projects ‚Äî including a portfolio project exploring mental health trends using public datasets.

# 📅 Week 6 – Python for Data Handling & Visualisation  
**Course Dates:** 17th – 20th June 2025

---

## 🗂️ Overview

- This week focused on building practical skills in **Python programming** and **data analysis using Pandas**.
- Filtering and sorting data, grouping and aggregating values, creating pivot tables, classifying categories, exporting data, and building basic visualisations.

---

## 📌 Day-by-Day Summary

### 🧠 **Day 2: Python Programming Fundamentals**
- Tackled the classic **FizzBuzz** logic challenge using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
- Strengthened comfort with Python syntax and output structure using loops.

### 📊 **Day 3: Pandas Essentials – Student Performance Dataset**

#### *Exercise 1: Loading and Exploring Data*
- Used `pandas` to load a CSV file.
- Viewed structure with `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.

#### *Exercise 2: Indexing and Slicing*
- Selected specific columns and rows.
- Filtered rows based on conditions (e.g. `class == 'Four'`).

#### *Exercise 3: Data Manipulation*
- Added a `'passed'` column using a condition.
- Renamed columns and dropped unnecessary ones.

#### *Exercise 4: Aggregation and Grouping*
- Grouped by `class` and `gender`.
- Calculated means and counts using `.groupby()`.

#### *Exercise 5: Advanced Operations*
- Created pivot tables by class and gender.
- Built a `'grade'` column using nested logic.
- Sorted records in descending order.

#### *Exercise 6: Exporting Data*
- Exported the cleaned and modified DataFrame to a new CSV.

#### *Exercise 7: Visualisation (Optional)*
- Created basic charts (bar, line, scatter) using `matplotlib`.

### 🌍 **Day 4: Applied Python – GDP Dataset**

#### *Task 1: Initial Exploration*
- Loaded GDP per capita data into a DataFrame.
- Displayed specific row ranges and columns (e.g., country and UN region).

#### *Task 2: Group Analysis Using Google Colab*
- Worked through an open-ended notebook to reinforce:
  - Data filtering
  - Summary statistics
  - Chart building
- Explored real-world trends collaboratively in a relaxed, creative session.

## ✅ Reflections

- Learned to clean, shape, and explore real datasets with **Pandas**  
- Found the step-by-step logic of **classification and grouping** especially useful  
- Visualisation helped bridge raw numbers to insight  
- Became more confident writing Python from scratch in notebooks  
- The group GDP project was a fun way to apply skills in a relaxed setting  
- I now feel more ready to use Python in portfolio projects and data challenges

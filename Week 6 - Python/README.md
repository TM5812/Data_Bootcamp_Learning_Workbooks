# Week 6 ‚Äì Python
üìÖ Course Dates: 17th ‚Äì 20th June 2025

## Overview
This week focused on developing practical Python skills for data handling, transformation, and exploration using `pandas`. The sessions included a mix of group activities and independent tasks designed to build confidence in core data manipulation techniques commonly used in technician and analyst roles.

# üß† Topics Covered

- Python scripting with FizzBuzz
- Loading and exploring CSV files using `pandas`
- Indexing, slicing, and selecting data
- Creating new columns and modifying existing ones
- Aggregation and grouping techniques
- Advanced operations like pivot tables and custom grading
- Exporting DataFrames to CSV
- Basic data visualisation (bar, line, scatter plots)
- Working with real-world datasets (GDP per Capita)

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Gained

- Writing Python scripts in Jupyter Notebooks
- Using `pandas` for:
  - Reading and inspecting CSV files
  - Selecting and filtering data with conditions
  - Creating, renaming, and dropping columns
  - Applying groupby and aggregation methods
  - Creating pivot tables and custom classifications (e.g. grade boundaries)
  - Sorting and exporting data
  - Using matplotlib/seaborn for simple visualisations
  - Navigating and working collaboratively in shared environments

## üîÑ Reflections

- Built confidence using Python syntax in practical scenarios  
- Learned how to manipulate and clean data programmatically  
- Understood how to apply real-world analysis techniques like grouping and grading  
- Practised using visual tools to present data clearly  
- Improved collaborative and independent data problem-solving

# Week 5 – Cloud Computing and Microsoft Azure  
📅 Course Dates: 9th June – 13th June 2025

## Overview
- This week introduced foundational cloud computing principles, data governance, and hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure. 
- Explored cloud models, legal considerations, and used Azure tools to query, store, and analyse data—culminating in a scenario-based project.

## 🗂️ Topics Covered

### ☁️ Cloud Computing Fundamentals (Day 1)
- Defined core concepts of cloud computing and real-world use cases (e.g., Netflix, Dropbox).
- Compared cloud service models:
  - **IaaS** – Infrastructure as a Service  
  - **PaaS** – Platform as a Service  
  - **SaaS** – Software as a Service  
- Explored deployment models:
  - **Public**, **Private**, **Hybrid**, **Community**  
- Reviewed major cloud providers:
  - Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud

### ⚖️ Data Laws & Governance (Day 2)
Studied UK data laws relevant to cloud-based data management:
- **Computer Misuse Act**  
- **Data Protection Act (DPA)**  
- Explored issues in:
  - Data privacy  
  - Copyright infringement  
  - Employee data rights  
- Emphasised compliance and accountability in digital environments

### 🧪 Azure Labs – Data Storage & Querying (Day 3)
Hands-on experience using Azure services for data analytics:
- Explored relational vs non-relational storage solutions  
- Practised SQL queries within the Azure portal  
- Visualised and analysed data using built-in Azure tools  

### 🐾 Scenario Project + DP-900 Prep (Day 4)
- Completed **DP-900** exam-style questions to consolidate theory
- Worked on a **scenario-based project**:  
  - Client: *Paws & Whiskers* Pet Shop  
  - Goal: Transition from manual to cloud-based data systems  
  - Applied Azure services for:
    - Data storage & retrieval  
    - SQL analytics  
    - Reporting dashboards  
- Addressed wider issues:
  - Security measures  
  - Backup strategies  
  - Legal compliance  

## 🛠️ Tools & Topics Practised

- **Microsoft Azure Portal**  
- SQL in cloud environments  
- Azure Data Explorer  
- Azure relational/non-relational data services  
- Data visualisation in cloud platforms  
- Cloud deployment strategies  
- Data privacy & compliance frameworks  

## ✅ Reflections

- Built confidence working with Azure services for data storage, querying, and visualisation  
- Understood practical implications of cloud models and legal requirements  
- Team collaboration during the *Paws & Whiskers* project enhanced communication in technical problem-solving  
- Encountered trial account limitations, but gained foundational experience  
- Identified future learning goals:  
  - Deepening knowledge of Azure tools  
  - Enhancing awareness of cloud security and compliance best practices
